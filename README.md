## 🌟 Overview

**SilentShield AI** is a privacy-first cybersecurity platform that combines **Machine Learning** and **rule-based threat intelligence** to identify phishing attacks, scams, malicious URLs, QR code traps, and suspicious documents.

Unlike traditional cloud-based security tools, SilentShield performs **all AI inference locally** using a custom Machine Learning model. No sensitive information is transmitted to external servers, ensuring complete privacy and low-latency analysis.

The project was developed as an **On-Device AI** solution, demonstrating how intelligent cybersecurity systems can operate entirely on a user's machine without relying on cloud AI services.

---

## 🚀 Why SilentShield AI?

Modern phishing attacks continue to evolve rapidly. Attackers now use AI-generated phishing emails, fake banking websites, QR-code phishing, credential harvesting, fake payment requests, social engineering, and cryptocurrency scams.

Most existing security platforms require users to upload their data to cloud servers before analysis. SilentShield solves this by bringing AI directly onto the user's device — the result is complete privacy, offline detection, faster analysis, and zero cloud dependency.

SilentShield is more than a phishing detector — it demonstrates how modern cybersecurity can leverage lightweight Machine Learning while respecting user privacy, combining AI, web security, privacy engineering, and human-centered design into one platform.

## ⚙️ Detection Pipeline

SilentShield AI follows a hybrid cybersecurity pipeline designed for privacy, speed, and accuracy.

**Step 1 — Input Collection:** the user submits an email, SMS, URL, PDF, QR code, image, or plain text.

**Step 2 — Data Extraction:** SilentShield extracts text locally, depending on input type:

| Input | Extraction Method |
|--------|-------------------|
| PDF | pdf.js |
| Image | OCR (Tesseract.js) |
| QR | jsQR |
| Text | Direct |
| URL | URL Parser |

No files are uploaded to external servers at any stage.

**Step 3 — AI Threat Classification:** extracted content is sent to the local FastAPI backend, which performs text vectorization (TF-IDF), ML prediction, confidence calculation, and threat classification — returning a prediction, confidence, threat level, keywords, and explanation.

**Step 4 — Rule Engine:** simultaneously checks credential-theft language, urgency phrases, banking keywords, dangerous TLDs, suspicious URLs, and fake login attempts, producing a second independent security score.

**Step 5 — Threat Fusion:** the ML result and rule-engine result are combined into a risk score, severity, threat category, highlighted evidence, detection rules, and AI explanation.

**Step 6 — Report Generation:** the user receives a threat intelligence report with evidence, highlighted indicators, AI prediction, and an exportable report.

cd SilentShield-AI
```

### Frontend Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend runs at **http://localhost:5173**

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Backend runs at **http://127.0.0.1:8000**

### Running SilentShield AI

Start both services in separate terminals:

```bash

## 🔍 Threat Detection Capabilities

SilentShield AI identifies credential harvesting, banking scams, fake login pages, fake payment requests, malicious URLs, QR phishing, invoice fraud, crypto scams, OTP theft, password theft, social engineering, typosquatting, urgency language, and fake security alerts.

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

SilentShield AI was designed around a Privacy-by-Design architecture.

| Question | Answer |
|---|---|
| Internet connection required? | No |
| Cloud AI used? | No |
| User data stored externally? | No |
| Third-party APIs used? | No |
| AI runs locally? | Yes |

The application never uploads user files, PDFs, screenshots, emails, or URLs, and never stores personal information externally. Every analysis is performed locally on the user's machine — making SilentShield suitable for privacy-sensitive environments where cloud-based security solutions aren't acceptable.

**Why on-device AI?** Traditional AI security tools send sensitive user information to cloud servers. SilentShield's local-first approach means lower latency, better privacy, offline capability, no API costs, no internet dependency, and full user control.

---

|---|---|
| **🏦 Banking** | Protect customers from fake banking websites, credential harvesting, payment fraud, and QR payment scams |
| **🏢 Enterprise Security** | Analyze suspicious emails, internal phishing attempts, malicious attachments, and fake login portals |
| **🎓 Education** | Teach cyber awareness, phishing detection, social engineering, and safe browsing |
| **👨‍💻 Individual Users** | Detect WhatsApp scams, SMS scams, fake giveaways, crypto fraud, and email phishing |
